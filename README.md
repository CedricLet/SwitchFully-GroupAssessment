1.1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
A huge amount of emails is received on a daily base via “info@parkshark.com”. Sorting these and forwarding them to the proper department is a time-consuming and boring job. Therefore you are appointed to create a small program to sort and delete these emails.
We want you to come with a solution for the requirements below and create:
• A representation of the program using pseudo-code
• You are expected to document more detail, open questions and assumptions in addition to
the pseudo-code as part of your solution.

o Emailscontainingthetext“proposal”shouldbeforwardedto“sales@parkshark.com” o Emails not belonging to any of the previous categories should be forwarded to
“reception@parkshark.com ”
After an email has been forwarded, the email can be deleted
After sorting the entire list of emails, the following information should be printed on screen (# represents the amount of emails sent)
        We have sorted # mails:
                # to recruitment
                # to spam
                # to sales
                # to reception
